# Emotion Detection Using CNN

## Project Description
This project focuses on building an **Emotion Detection System** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify facial expressions from images. The model learns facial features from pixel data and predicts emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise.

The project demonstrates practical knowledge of **computer vision**, **deep learning**, and **image preprocessing** using Python-based tools.

## Key Features
- Facial emotion classification using CNN  
- Image preprocessing and normalization  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Visualization of predictions  
- Implemented and tested in Google Colab  

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV  
- **Numerical Computing:** NumPy  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib  
- **Environment:** Google Colab
